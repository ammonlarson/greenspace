# ---------- Shared-RDS VPC Peering ----------
#
# Provides a private network path from the API Lambda (in this VPC's private
# subnets) to the shared RDS instance owned by `ammonlarson/infra-shared-db`.
# The shared RDS lives in that account's default VPC; we create a peering
# connection per Greenspace environment so staging and prod fail
# independently.
#
# Gated on `var.shared_db_vpc_id`: when null (the default), no peering
# resources are created and the apply is a no-op. The variable is set in the
# environment configs once the shared-db side has provisioned the route +
# RDS SG ingress documented in `docs/adr/0001-shared-rds-connectivity.md`.
#
# `auto_accept = true` works because both VPCs live in the same AWS account
# and region (per the same-account assumption documented in the ADR; the
# CI Terraform IAM scoping does not enforce it). The accepter-side route,
# RDS SG ingress, and `accepter.allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution` are owned
# by the shared-db repo so each side manages its own VPC's resources.
