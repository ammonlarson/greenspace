# 🚨 STOP AND READ - MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS 🚨

⚠️ **DO NOT SKIP THIS FILE.** ⚠️

This file contains **MANDATORY** instructions that **MUST** be followed for **EVERY** task.

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. No "I'll do it later."**

# 📋 MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR EVERY TASK

Every task follows this exact pattern. **No skipping phases.**

## 🟡 PHASE 1: PRE-WORK (Before Writing Code)

### 1.1 Load Context

Always start by reading the issue via the project's ticket provider using the MCP tool. Add the labels "agent active" and "claude" to the ticket.

**Confirm:**

- [ ] Ticket read and understood
- [ ] Labels added
- [ ] Requirements clear (if not, use AskUserQuestion)

### 1.2 Create Planning Document

Create `.agent/ticket-<number>-plan.md` with:

- **Analysis**: Current state, target state, approach
- **Task Checklist**: All steps needed
- **Implementation Summary**: Files to modify, estimated impact

**Confirm:**

- [ ] Plan document created
- [ ] Approach is sound (if uncertain, get user approval)

### 1.3 Setup Branch

```bash
# Ensure on latest main
git checkout main && git pull
```

Create feature branch using the project format.

**CHECKPOINT: Phase 1 complete?**

- ✅ Ticket read + labels added
- ✅ Plan created
- ✅ Branch created from latest main

**If NO to any item, STOP and complete it NOW.**

---

## 🟢 PHASE 2: EXECUTION (Write Code)

### Code Guidelines

**Critical Rules:**

1. **Minimal changes** - Address task requirements ONLY
2. **DRY/KISS/YAGNI** - Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering
3. **Root causes** - Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
4. **No scope creep** - Don't refactor unrelated code
5. **Concise communication** - Remove filler, use bullets

**Safety:**

- DO NOT modify logic/variables unrelated to the task
- Use `trash` for deletions, never `rm -rf`
- Never skip pre-commit hooks without explicit permission
- Never force push to main/master

**Best Practices:**

- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistent formatting and style
- Add validation for user input
- Provide user-facing error messages (not just console.error)
- Consider edge cases and error states
- Ensure that any relevant changes are reflected in README.md

**Workflow Customizations**
Follow all Task Execution Workflow Customizations steps or instructions included in this file.

## 🔵 PHASE 3: VALIDATION (Before Creating/Updating PR)

**Complete ALL items before creating PR:**

### 3.1 Run Tests

```bash
npm test  # or equivalent for this project
```

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage ≥80% for touched files (add tests if needed)

**If no test script exists:** Note "N/A" in plan

### 3.2 Run Linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

- [ ] No new linting errors introduced

### 3.3 Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No errors or critical warnings

### 3.4 Pre-commit Checks

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass (if configured)
- [ ] No debugging code left (console.log, debugger, etc.)

**CHECKPOINT: All validation items complete?**

**If NO, fix issues before proceeding.**

---

## ⚪ PHASE 4: SUBMISSION

### 4.1 Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Create PR with:

- **Title**: Conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- **Body**: Include ticket number, summary, test plan
- **Link**: Reference ticket (#<number>)

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: <description>" --body "..."
```

### 4.2 PR Review (MANDATORY)

Use the pr-reviewer agent to review:

```
Review PR #<number> comprehensively and post findings as PR review comment
```

- [ ] PR review completed by agent
- [ ] Review posted as PR comment using `gh pr review`

### 4.3 Address Feedback

**For EVERY piece of feedback:**

- Either fix the issue and update PR
- Or explain why it shouldn't be addressed
- For any issues that are judged to be valuable but out of scope, create a new ticket via the project's ticket provider using the MCP tool.

Post response using:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "Addressed: ... / Not addressed: ..."
```

- [ ] All feedback addressed or justified
- [ ] Response posted to PR

### 4.4 Remove label

Remove the "agent active" label from the ticket.

### 4.5 Final Steps

Add ammoml as a reviewer.

```bash
# Add reviewer
gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer ammonl
```

Leave a comment on the ticket, referencing the PR and provide a summary of the implementation.


- [ ] Reviewer added (ammonl)
- [ ] Issue commented with PR link + implementation summary
- [ ] Ready for final review

---

## Command Style

Never chain commands with `&&`. Use separate commands instead.

Bad:

```bash
cd foo && npm install && npm test
```

Good:

```bash
cd foo
npm install
npm test
```

**Never use heredocs in Bash commands.** Heredocs embed newlines into the command string, which breaks permission pattern matching.

For multi-line `gh` command bodies, write to a temp file instead:

```bash
printf '%s' "body content here" > /tmp/pr-body.txt
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr-body.txt
```

Or use a single-quoted string with explicit \n escaping if the body is short enough to fit on one line.

The key flags that accept files:

```
- `gh pr create --body-file <file>`
- `gh pr comment --body-file <file>`
- `gh pr review --body-file <file>`
- `gh issue comment --body-file <file>`
```

# Python Guidelines

Always use uv to manage python environments and run python commands. Check at the root folder for existing environments before creating a new one.
When working in the Python coding language, follow “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python” conventions for project structure, packaging, tooling, and general best practices:
Core principles

- Prefer readability and explicitness over cleverness.
- Keep modules small and cohesive; avoid deep inheritance and over-abstraction.
- Prefer the standard library where practical; add dependencies only when justified.
  Project layout and structure
- Default to a `src/` layout for packages (e.g., `src/<package_name>/...`) and keep import paths clean.
- Keep configuration, documentation, and tooling files at the repo root.
- Put tests in `tests/` and write tests that are fast, deterministic, and isolated.
- Organize code by feature/domain rather than by “layers” unless the project clearly benefits.
  Environment and dependencies
- Always assume an isolated virtual environment.
- Prefer pinned, reproducible dependencies (lockfile or pinned requirements).
- Do not instruct to modify global Python installations.
  Code style
- Follow PEP 8 naming and formatting conventions.
- Prefer f-strings, pathlib, context managers, and type hints where they improve clarity.
- Write docstrings for public modules/classes/functions; keep them concise and useful.
- Use exceptions intentionally; never blanket-catch without re-raising or logging.
  Tooling (assume these unless the user specifies otherwise)
- Formatting/linting: use Ruff (and Black only if requested or already present).
- Type checking: use mypy or pyright if the project uses typing seriously.
- Testing: use pytest; use fixtures; avoid network in unit tests.
- Logging: use the standard `logging` module; no print statements in library code.
  Async and concurrency
- Use asyncio only for I/O concurrency; avoid making everything async.
- Do not block the event loop; if forced to call blocking code from async code, use `asyncio.to_thread()`.
- Do not add numbering to comments.
