## 4. Public Experience

### 4.1 Pre-Open Mode
- Shown when current time < opening datetime.
- Must display:
  - exact opening datetime in local Danish format and timezone
  - short explanation of how registration works
  - eligibility summary
  - contact emails for support

### 4.2 Open Mode
- Shown when current time >= opening datetime.
- Landing shows both greenhouses with:
  - total box count
  - occupied count
  - available count
- User can enter greenhouse view (2D map) and inspect each box.

### 4.3 Greenhouse UI
- 2D map per greenhouse, inspired by provided reference photos.
- Box state visuals:
  - available
  - occupied
  - reserved (admin-held, not public-selectable)
- Public can only select available boxes.

### 4.4 Registration Form Fields
- Name (required)
- Email (required, valid email format)
- Address input with Danish address autocomplete/validation (DAWA):
  - street fixed to `Else Alfelts Vej`
  - house number must be 122-202 inclusive
  - floor/door rules:
    - for 138, 144, and all >160, floor and door are required
    - for other valid numbers, floor/door optional
- Language preference captured (`da` or `en`) based on browser default and user override.

### 4.5 One Apartment Rule
- Uniqueness key: normalized apartment address.
- If apartment already has an active registration and user submits new one:
  - show explicit confirmation that this is a switch, not a second box
  - on confirm:
    - old registration is deactivated
    - newly chosen box becomes active
    - old box becomes publicly available immediately

### 4.6 Unregister Policy
- Public users cannot unregister in the system.
- UI directs users to email organizers if they no longer want the box.

### 4.7 Full Capacity and Waitlist
- If no public boxes are available, user can join waitlist.
- Waitlist ordering is FIFO by initial waitlist timestamp.
- If same apartment joins waitlist again, preserve earliest timestamp.
- Admin assignment from waitlist removes assigned entry automatically.

## 5. Eligibility and Validation Rules

### 5.1 Address Eligibility
- Valid street: `Else Alfelts Vej` only.
- Valid house number range: 122-202 inclusive.
- Apartment identifier required (full normalized key includes floor/door).
- Stricter requirement:
  - floor + door mandatory for 138, 144, and house numbers 161-202.

### 5.2 Data Validation
- Server-side validation is mandatory for all rules.
- Client-side validation mirrors server rules for UX only.

## 6. Admin Experience

### 6.1 Admin Authentication

### 6.2 Reservation Management
- Admin can:
  - create reservation for any box and any address (override mode)
  - move reservation between boxes
  - remove reservation
- On admin removal:
  - prompt: make box public now? (default configurable)
  - if no, keep as `reserved` with special reserved label (default: `Admin Hold`) and hidden from public selection

### 6.3 Waitlist Management

- Assign waitlist entry to a selected box.
- Assigned entry is automatically removed from waitlist.

### 6.4 Email on Admin Changes
- For add/move/remove, email toggle defaults to ON.

## 8. Privacy and Consent

### 8.1 Required Form Consent Copy
- Explain collected data:
  - name, email, apartment address, registration and waitlist records
- Explain purpose:
  - administration of 2026 planter box season
  - communication regarding registration changes
- Explain retention:
  - operational data and audit history retained for administrative traceability
- Link contact emails for data questions:
  - `elise7284@gmail.com`
  - `lena@gmail.com`

### 8.2 Data Visibility
- Public never sees registrant names/emails/addresses.
- Admin-only views expose personal data.

## 9. Audit and Traceability

### 9.1 Audit Requirement
- Every create/update/delete/change-state operation on critical entities must emit immutable audit event.

### 9.2 Must-Audit Operations
- registration create/switch/remove/move
- waitlist add/remove/assign/reorder-preserve decisions
- box state changes (available/occupied/reserved)
- opening datetime changes
- admin account create/delete/password change
- outbound email events and whether edited before send

### 9.3 Audit Event Fields
- event ID
- timestamp (UTC)
- actor type (`public`, `admin`, `system`)
- actor identifier (admin ID or derived context)
- action type
- entity type + entity ID
- before snapshot (JSON)
- after snapshot (JSON)
- reason/notes (optional)

### 9.4 Recovery Support
- Admin UI must include timeline/history view.
- Manual restore is done by creating corrective admin actions, not by mutating history rows.

## 10. Data Model (Logical)

### 10.1 Core Tables
- `admins`
- `admin_credentials`
- `sessions`
- `system_settings`
- `greenhouses`
- `planter_boxes`
- `registrations`
- `waitlist_entries`
- `emails`
- `audit_events`

### 10.2 Key Constraints
- One active registration per normalized apartment key.
- One active occupant per box where box state is occupiable.
- Waitlist uniqueness by apartment key with earliest timestamp preserved.
- Box states:
  - `available`
  - `occupied`
  - `reserved`

## 11. API Surface (High Level)

### 11.1 Public
- `GET /public/status` (open/closed, opening datetime)
- `GET /public/greenhouses` (summary counts)
- `GET /public/boxes` (public-safe box state)
- `POST /public/register`
- `POST /public/waitlist`

### 11.2 Admin
- `POST /admin/auth/login`
- `POST /admin/auth/change-password`
- `GET /admin/registrations`
- `POST /admin/registrations`
- `POST /admin/registrations/move`
- `POST /admin/registrations/remove`
- `POST /admin/waitlist/assign`
- `PATCH /admin/settings/opening-time`
- `POST /admin/admins`
- `DELETE /admin/admins/:id`
- `GET /admin/audit`

## 12. AWS Architecture (Recommended MVP)

### 12.1 Frontend
- Next.js web app deployed to AWS Amplify Hosting (or CloudFront+S3 static export if chosen).
- Domain mapping for `greenspace.un17hub.com`.

### 12.2 Backend
- API Gateway + Lambda (Node.js/TypeScript) for public/admin APIs.
- RDS PostgreSQL (or Aurora Serverless v2 Postgres) for transactional data.

### 12.3 Supporting Services
- SES for transactional emails.
- S3 for static map assets and generated email map images.
- Secrets Manager for DB creds, admin seed secret material.
- CloudWatch logs/metrics + alarms.

### 12.4 Security Controls
- Password hashing: Argon2id or bcrypt with strong cost factor.
- HttpOnly secure session cookies for admin auth.
- Least-privilege IAM for Lambda and SES.
- Server-side authorization on all admin routes.

## 13. Localization

### 13.1 Languages
- `da` and `en` across:
  - public site
  - forms + validation messages
  - emails
  - admin messaging defaults

### 13.2 Language Selection
- Default from browser locale.
- User can switch manually.
- Selected language persisted in registration record for follow-up communications.

## 14. Design Direction

### 14.1 Visual Intent
- Warm, community-focused rooftop-garden look.
- Inspired by UN17 architecture and greenhouse atmosphere.
- 2D map interactions over photorealistic rendering.

### 14.2 Components
- Greenhouse cards with occupancy progress.
- Map with clickable planter boxes.
- Box card with number, name, and custom illustration.
- Clear state badges and legends.

## 15. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Repo scaffolding and CI
- DB schema + migrations
- Seed data:
  - greenhouses
  - 29 planter boxes
  - initial admins
  - default opening datetime
- Basic public read endpoints

### Phase 2: Public Registration
- Greenhouse pages + 2D maps
- Address validation integration (DAWA)
- Registration flow + switch confirmation
- Confirmation emails with care guidelines

### Phase 3: Waitlist + Admin
- Waitlist logic and UI
- Admin authentication and dashboard
- Reservation add/move/remove with optional email editor
- Admin account management

### Phase 4: Hardening
- Full audit timeline UI
- Localization completeness review
- Accessibility pass
- Operational alerts and backup checks

## 16. Acceptance Criteria

- Pre-open mode blocks registration before configured datetime.
- Open mode allows box selection and valid registration.
- Apartment uniqueness is enforced by normalized address key.
- Switch flow explicitly warns and releases previous box on confirm.
- Public never sees personal data.
- Waitlist preserves earliest timestamp for repeat apartment submissions.
- Admin remove flow offers public vs reserved decision.
- Every critical change appears in audit history with actor and before/after.
- Emails are sent from `greenspace@un17hub.com` with correct language and care guidelines.
- Admins can create/delete other admins and change own password.
